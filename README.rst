Introduction
============

This add-on adds social media buttons to your Plone site, in a way that
protects users' privacy. Instead of loading the buttons immediately, a
placeholder button is shown (greyed out). When this is clicked, the real button
is loaded.

This functionality is provided by the `socialshareprivacy` javascripts by
heise.de: http://www.heise.de/extras/socialshareprivacy
This add-on makes this code easily installable in Plone.
